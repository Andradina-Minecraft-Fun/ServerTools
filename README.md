# ServerTools

ServerTools is a collection of small pieces of code, so you don't need to create several separate plugins! 

It is a plugin for personal use, but very useful. If it takes a larger proportion than expected, it may be separated into other plugins.

# Features

- [x] Nerf criatures, by reason of spawn! So, you can give 50% chance to spawn or not iron golem by vilager defence (natural iron farms) or spawn blaze spawner farms by 70%;
- [ ] Create command alias, but customizing parameters to, for example `!message` run `/g message`
- [ ] Create a timmer to run commands, for exemple, run a list of commands every hour, with a random placeholder, to randomize player or a number or list values, so we can give a random player, random item time, time to time
